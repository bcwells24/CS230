-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a company focused on developing engaging online games. They wanted to expand their existing game, "Draw It or Lose It," to multiple platforms. Seeking a scalable, flexible, and secure solution to host "Draw It or Lose It." The game required efficient memory and storage management to handle high-definition images and support high traffic. They also needed the game to run seamlessly on various operating systems and devices.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing this documentation for the gaming room, I did well in explaining the UML Diagram and making recommendations to the customer, The Gaming Room. I believe the software design document is written at a level that can be understood by a lower level of technical expertise while still being specific and thorough.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The process of working through a design document was beneficial because it forced me to think through the entire system architecture and the bigger picture of the code at hand. This helped with ensuring customer requirements were being met with code that reflects those requirements the first time, ensuring a more efficient and effective development process. 

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one part of this document, it would be the operating platforms evaluation table. I am not familiar with operating platforms outside of Windows. I would like to take more time to not only research but also use the other operating platforms to increase my level of comfort with them. In doing that coupled with the research, I feel like I would be able to better evaluate various operating platforms and effectively document that information. 

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the user’s needs, I conducted thorough requirements gathering by reading all documentation about the client that was available. I focused on translating these needs into technical requirements by prioritizing features like scalability, flexibility, and security. Incorporating user requirements and testing the code ensured that the final software design aligned with the client’s expectations. Setting clear parameters and objectives ensures the final product aligns with the user's expectations and requirements. Ignoring user needs during the design process leads to wasted time and effort, often resulting in a product that is either unnecessary or lacks essential features. Consequently, this necessitates either fixing the product post-launch or risking project failure, requiring someone else to address the shortcomings.

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing the software by first understanding the client’s requirements and constraints. I used a modular design strategy to ensure scalability and flexibility. Key steps included defining the system architecture, selecting appropriate technologies, and creating detailed design documents. I employed best practices in software engineering, such as using microservices for scalability and API gateways for managing and securing traffic. In the future, extensive diagramming and requirements gathering will be some techniques I would use in a future software application.
